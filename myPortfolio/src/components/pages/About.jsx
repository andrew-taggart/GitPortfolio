                Past: Pre-GA
                My background has taken me through a variety of experiences where I adapted to the needs of each role.  My ability to analyze a situation or problem for finer details has helped me excel in a variety of roles including sales, supply chain, and coaching.  This skill and my interest in complex problem solving is what eventually brought me to software development.

                Past: w/GA
                Recently, I have worked through General Assemblies Software Development course, which I have worked on several full-stack applications.  One of the projects that I am most proud of was a MERN progress tracking app that I developed with a team of four.  I specifically took care of the backend development.  Creating our database from scratch and ensuring that we had a seamless connection to the front end, with tools for the end user to efficiently Create, Read, Update, and Delete as necessary.
